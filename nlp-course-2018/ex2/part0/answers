a. It happenes because of the following rules:
1	NP	NP PP
1	NP	Det Noun
which are recursive. Noun can expand itself to Adj Noun infinite number of times, theoreticlly. same with NP, which can expand to NP PP.
As a result, NP can turn to NP PP PP PP PP .... (PP infinite number of times).

b. The rule Noun can turn to either of the following; Adj Noun, or to 5 different words.
Therefore, there is a 16.66% that a noun will expand to Adj Noun, but from there, to enable Adj Adj Noun, it needs to expand to Adj Noun again, which is (1/6)^2. That is true for any length of adjective chain n: (1/6)^n

c. Increase weight of non recursive rules solves a. I tried increasing the non recursive rule to 3, while the recursive rule has weight of 1, made the probability of the recursive and increasing weight of Noun -> Adj Noun to 6, will enhance the probability of it, and it will become less rare.
