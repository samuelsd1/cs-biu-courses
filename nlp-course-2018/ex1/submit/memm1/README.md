# How to Run MEMM1:
1. ConvertFeatures with the right parameters. (if you are unsure, run without parameters, see the prompt)
2. ExtractFeatures.
	Now, this script creates a file called tagset_map, which is crucial to MEMM2.
	Please, when running MEMM2, make sure this file is in the same directory as MEMM2 files.
	I know, this is not very elegant, but compressing the tagset mapping into features file is not elegant as well.
3. TrainSolver
